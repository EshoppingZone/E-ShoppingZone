#First create databases for all services before running. 


#Here we have used two types of databases MySQL, MongoDB. 



#Database commands for MySQL 

-->create database  project_db //database for profile service. 

-->create database  wallet_service //database for wallet service. 




#Database commands  for MongoDB

-->use product_db  //database for product service. 

-->use  demo // database for cart service. 

-->use test // database for order service. 



After that open CMD  from MongoDB  bin  folder  and run the command
